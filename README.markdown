Borrow
======

_Concept borrowed from phenomenon named *byttelane* in Norwegian_

About
-----
The project is curated by Ola Loevholm from [lovholm.net](http://www.lovholm.net). The project is utilising new technologies and are more of that sort of project one would do to experiment with new technologies than earn money from. I'm currently looking for work in the Oslo-region, so if you think this is interesting, or just need someone to do some work for you. Please contact me. 

Development
-----------
This page will be collecting data about books, videos and games people have and will try to make it possible to share these cultural objects. As an owner of an exemplar of a cultural work you can borrow this to friends and relatives for free. Perhaps information technology can save the environment if information exchange are made easier. Let's try.
